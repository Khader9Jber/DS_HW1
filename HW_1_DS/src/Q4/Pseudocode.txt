Q4:
Suppose Alice has picked three distinct integers and placed them into a stack S in random order.
Write a short, straight line piece of pseudocode (with no loops or recursion) that uses only one
comparison and only one variable x, yet that results in variable x storing the largest of Aliceâ€™s three
integers with probability 2/3

ANS:

result = (stack.pop() < stack.top())? result = stack.pop(): pass;

We compare the first to numbers from the top.
then we compare the largest between these two numbers with the third number.
(The percentage is 2/3).
